# Hai, as we say here.

My name is Ahmad Husen, but most people call me Husen. I am a self-taught software
developer from Klaten, Indonesia. A small town located between Yogyakarta and 
Surakarta.

I started my journey in software development back in junior high, when I wrote 
CSS to customize my blog. What began as a hobby soon turned into a professional 
pursuit, and since 2016, I’ve been focused on building high-quality software 
with an emphasis on **simplicity**, **stability**, and **performance** to create 
the **best software experience** possible.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked on various projects, always striving to create 
user-friendly, scalable, and maintainable solutions. I believe great software 
balances functionality and ease of use, and I’ve adapted to new challenges 
across different technologies and industries.

In my current role as a Technical Lead Assistant, I help guide my team’s 
technical decisions and contribute to the overall direction of projects. I enjoy 
collaborating with others, supporting team growth, and ensuring we deliver 
efficient, high-quality solutions. I’m always looking for opportunities to 
improve both as a developer and a team player.

## Experience

Since 2016, I have worked on several projects. For over 8 years, I have been 
using software technologies to help companies increase productivity which leads 
to increased profits. Along with that, I have also worked on several freelance 
and side projects to date.

Apart from that, I also create and contribute to several
[open source projects](/project). I do it to learn new things,
add to my new skills, and contribute to the community.

## Skill

I believe there is no such thing as the best programming language or framework
in software development. The truth is there is always the right tools for the
job. And as a curious person, I am always up to date and open to new
technologies.

But, most of the time, I'm comfortable working with Go, 
TypeScript (or JavaScript), SQL, HTML, and CSS, sometimes Rust too. I'm 
currently focusing on [Go](https://go.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), 
[Express](https://expressjs.com/), [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), 
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), 
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and 
more...

## I have a few hobbies

When I'm not coding, I'll stay as far away from my laptop as possible. One thing
that has always been able to help me to do that is my motorcycle. I usually ride
it around town or even take long trips if I have enough time. I also like
motorsport in general. But I've always loved MotoGP and been a fan of it since I
was in 5th grade.

## My other hobbies?

I don't have many other hobbies, but when I have free time, I usually write an
article on [my blog](/article) about
something I've just learned, and sometimes watch movies too.
