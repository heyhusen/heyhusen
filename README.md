# Hi there, I'm **Husen**. ðŸ‘‹  

I build things that live from code.  

I'm a software developer with a main focus on simplicity, stability and 
performance to give you the best software experience possible.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently building **ERP** software at **Eigen**.

 ðŸ‘¯ I'm available for freelance projects.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about software development, tech, or anything else! It would be even better if youâ€™re into motorcycle racing. Iâ€™m always up for a good conversation on that too.
