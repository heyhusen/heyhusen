# Hi there 👋

I'm **Husen**.  

I build things that live from code.  

I'm a software developer with a main focus on simplicity, stability and 
performance to give you the best software experience possible.

Currently building **ERP** software at **Eigen**.

I'm available for freelance projects.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about software development, tech, or anything else! It would be even better if you’re into motorcycle racing. I’m always up for a good conversation on that too.
